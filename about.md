In a world of applications and mobile devices, IT must secure data that resides on third-party servers and travels over third-party networks to employee-owned mobile devices. Existing security technologies are simply not suited to solving this task, since they are developed to secure the corporate network perimeter. Bitglass is a Cloud Access Security Broker that delivers innovative technologies that transcend the network perimeter to deliver total data protection for the enterprise - in the cloud, on mobile devices and anywhere on the internet.

Bitglass was founded in 2013 by a team of industry veterans with a proven track record of innovation and execution. Bitglass is based in Silicon Valley and backed by venture capital from NEA, Norwest and Singtel Innov8.
